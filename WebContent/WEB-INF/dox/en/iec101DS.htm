<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>Every datasource requires a <b>Name</b>, that can contain any
description.</p>

<p>All initial parameters depend on the slave device configurations
and should be configured correctly..</p>

<p>The <b>Update period</b> corresponds the time interval upon which
the system makes calls 2 and, if necessary, class 1 requisitions to the
slave device.</p>

<p>The <b> GI relative period</b> corresponds to the time interval
upon which the system makes the requisition of one <b>General
Interrogation</b> to the device and is <b>relative to the update period</b>
defined beforehand. So, if the update period = 2s and the GI period =
30, <b>the datasource sends one General Interrogation every 60
seconds to the device</b>.</p>
