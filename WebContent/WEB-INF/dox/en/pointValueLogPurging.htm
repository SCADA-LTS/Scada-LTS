<p>The <b>Purge now</b> functionality allows the easy purging of point values on an age basis. Values that are purged are permanently deleted and unrecoverable following this operation. Use the <b>Purge data older than</b> controls, or check <b>Purge all data</b> and press the <b>Purge now</b> button. Deletion is done asynchronously, so you may navigate away from this page or change other point properties, but by doing so you will not receive a purge completed confirmation.</p>
