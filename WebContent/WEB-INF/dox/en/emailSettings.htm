  Email settings are used for all emailing activities within the application instance.
</p>

<p>
  <b>SMTP host</b> is the name of the host where your MTA is running. If your host requires authentication, check the 
  <b>Use authorization</b> box, and fill in the <b>Username</b> and <b>Password</b> fields. Check the <b>Enable TLS</b>
  checkbox if your server requires it.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>'From' address</b> is the address that will be used as the from address on each email. The <b>'From' name</b> 
  is an optional field with which to specify an alias&mdash;or 'personal' name&mdash;to display as the email sender.
</p>

<p>
  Use the <b>Content type</b> select box to choose the type of content you wish to have in the Mango emails. By default
  <b>HTML and text</b> is selected, which causes Mango to create a multi-part MIME email with both "text/html" and 
  "text/text" parts. If <b>HTML only</b> is chosen the email may still be a multi-part if there are attachments or 
  in-line content, but will be otherwise be single part. If <b>Text only</b> is chosen, the email will always be a 
  simple single part. <b>Note:</b> scheduled report emails are always sent as HTML-only due to the content they include.
</p>

<p>
  When you are finished with your email settings, you can test them by clicking the <img src="images/email_go.png"/> 
  icon. This will attempt to send an email to your email address using the settings you have entered.
