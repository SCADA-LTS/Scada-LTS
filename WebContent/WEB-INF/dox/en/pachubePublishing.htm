<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The Pachube publisher sends each point update (or change, as appropriate) to Pachube using the given API key, feed 
  ID, and data stream ID as a separate HTTP request.
</p>

<h1>Properties</h1>
<p>
  The <b>API Key</b> is needed to update private data. You can find it in the "my settings" area when you log in to 
  your Pachube account. <b>Timeout</b> and <b>Retries</b> parameters are used to handle failures.
</p>

<h1>HTTP response</h1>
<p>
  Any other response code than a "200 OK" is considered an error, and an alarm will be raised. Note that - depending on 
  your account with Pachube - API request restrictions may apply. See 
  <a href="http://community.pachube.com/api#rate_limit">http://community.pachube.com/api#rate_limit</a> for details.
</p>

<h1>Published points</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Points</b> section lists the points to be published. Point publishing can be enabled 
  (<img src="images/brick_go.png"/>) or disabled (<img src="images/brick_stop.png"/>). Disabling a point allows it to 
  not be used without having to explicitly delete it. The <b>Feed ID</b> and <b>Data stream ID</b> values determine 
  the data stream that will be updated.
</p>
<p>
  To add a point to the point list, select it in the points list and click the <img src="images/icon_comp_add.png"/> 
  icon. To delete an existing point, click its associated <img src="images/bullet_delete.png"/> icon.
