<p>The <b>data source list</b> lists all data sources defined in the system, displaying the name, type, connection attributes, and status for each. <b>Connection</b> attributes are configuration values that depend on the data source type. The <b>Status</b> determines whether the data source is enabled (<img src="images/database_go.png"/>) or disabled (<img src="images/database_stop.png"/>). Clicking on the status icon toggles the data source's status.</p>

<p>To add a new data source, select the data source type from the list and click the <img src="images/icon_ds_add.png"/> icon at the top of the list. To edit an existing data source, click the <img src="images/icon_ds_edit.png"/> icon associated with the data source. To delete a data source, click the <img src="images/icon_ds_delete.png"/> icon associated with the data source. Depending upon the amount of data stored for the data source it may take a significant amount of time to delete; be sure to let the delete process finish before continuing.</p>

<p>The <img src="images/arrow_out.png"/> and <img src="images/arrow_in.png"/> icons toggle the display of the points defined for the data source. Similar to data sources, points can be enabled (<img src="images/brick_go.png"/>) or disabled (<img src="images/brick_stop.png"/> here.</p>
