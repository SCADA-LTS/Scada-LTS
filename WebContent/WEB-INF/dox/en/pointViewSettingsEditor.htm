  This panel allows the modification of various display attributes for the point view. If entered, the <b>Point name 
  override</b> value will be displayed in the point info popup instead of the given name of the point. If not entered, 
  the given name is displayed. The <b>Settable override</b> allows settable point to appear non-settable in the context 
  of the view.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Background color</b> overrides the default interface colour. If left blank, the default colour is used. Enter 
  'transparent' to have no background colour or border displayed (useful if the view's background image already 
  provides a background context for the point view). Otherwise, any value acceptable as a CSS color can be entered. 
  Only the colour <em>value</em> should be provided. For example, valid values for red include (excluding the quotes) 
  "#FF0000", "red", "#F00", "rgb(255, 0, 0), and "rgb(100%, 0%, 0%)" A simple description of valid colour values can be 
  found <a href="http://www.devx.com/projectcool/Article/19851" target="_blank">here</a>. For exhaustive details, see 
  the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/" target="_blank">W3C</a>

  The <b>Display controls</b> check box determines if hover controls will be displayed for a point view. Removing hover
  controls from points can reduce clutter in dense views. It can also make for a more "static" feeling view which can 
  be useful for remote views.
