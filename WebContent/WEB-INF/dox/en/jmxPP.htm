<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  A reference to a JMX point consists of an <b>Object name</b>, a <b>Attribute name</b>, and optionally - if the
  attribute is a composite data type - a <b>Composite item name</b>. The simplest way to find values is to use the JMX
  server inspection feature.
</p>
<p>
  The point <b>Data type</b> is the ScadaBR representation of the value, not the JMX value type. Regardless, it is best 
  to match the data type as closely with the JMX type for best results.
