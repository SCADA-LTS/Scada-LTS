<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>You can add one single point, defining its index, or <b>Add
several datapoints</b> defining the minimum and maximum indexes.</p>
<h1>Commands</h1>
<p>For points of type OUTPUT you need to define the command
parameters to be used as default, should they not be specified during
runtime. For BYNARY OUTPUT type points, the valid commands (that should be executed on the appropriated
watchlist icon, as well as other datasources) are:</p>
<p>pon/poff -> pulse on/off</p>
<p>lon/loff -> latch on/off</p>
<p>close/trip -> close/trip</p>
<p>All commands can be followed by two parameters, the command's TIME ON and TIME OFF in milliseconds. For exemple:
pon,500,200</p>
<p>It is possible to enter only "1", "0", "true" ou "false".
In this case, the sent command will be the default command specified to the point.</p>
<h1>Exemple</h1>
<p>Binary point registered as CLOSE/TRIP, TIME ON 1000 e TIME OFF
0</p>
<p>1 -> the system will send the CLOSE command with TIME ON 1000 and TIME
OFF 0</p>
<p>0 -> the system will send the TRIP command with TIME ON 1000 and TIME OFF
0</p>
<p>pon -> the system will send the PULSE ON command with TIME ON 1000 and
TIME OFF 0</p>
<p>poff,300,0 -> the system will send the PULSE OFF command with TIME ON
300 and TIME OFF 0</p>
