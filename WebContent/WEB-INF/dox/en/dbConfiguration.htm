<p>
  The ScadaBR currently allows the use of two Database Management Systems (DBMS): <b>Derby</b> and <b>MySQL</b>.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Derby</b> is used as default by the system. However, if you need some change in its initial configuration,
  is necessary to modify the file located in <b>"ScadaBR*/WEB-INF/classes/env.properties"</b> and <b>"ScadaBR*/WEB-INF/classes/env.properties.derby"</b>.
</p>

<p>
  To use <b>MySQL</b>, you must enter the data necessary for its correct use. Thus, the file needed to be modified
  is in <b>"ScadaBR*/WEB-INF/classes/env.properties.mysql"</b>. Basically, the following parameters must be entered:
  	<p>
	  <b>db.username: </b> Username.
  	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>db.password: </b> User password.
  	</p>
  
 Made the necessary changes, you must choose <b>MySQL</b> as an option and click the icon to save. Then restart the application server (e.g Tomcat). 
</p>

<p>
  <b>ScadaBR*: </b> ScadaBR location on the application server(ex: "Pasta_Tomcat/webapps/ScadaBR").
