<p>The <b>Data type</b> is the Mango representation of the value. Received data is automatically converted to the required data type.  The <b>Value RegEx</b> determines where in the returned content to find the point value. See the "Regular Expressions" documentation for more information. Note that only the <i>first instance</i> of the expression found in the content is used.</p>

<p>The <b>Ignore if missing</b> checkbox indicates whether missing values on a page should be considered error conditions. If unchecked and the value is not found in the content, a data source exception event will be raised. If checked, the event is suppressed, and the point is not updated.</p>

<p>For the binary data type, the <b>Binary 0 value</b> can be defined. If the value found in the content matches it, the point will be updated with 0. Otherwise, the point is updated with 1. For the numeric data type a <b>Number format</b> can be defined, which provides information on how the text value found by the RegEx should be parsed. See the "Number formats" documentation for more information.</p>

<p>A <b>Time RegEx</b> can be defined to locate the value's time stamp in the returned content. If the RegEx is defined, a <b>Time format</b> must also be entered, which provides information on how the text time found by the RegEx should be parsed. See the "Date/time formats" documentation for more information.</p>
