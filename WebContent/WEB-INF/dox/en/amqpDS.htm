<p>AMQP v0.9.1 Data Source is a data source which allows to connect to external RabbitMQ instance via AMQP protocol</p>
<p>AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an Open Standard for messaging between different platforms
    in different languages in middleware.</p>
<p>Some technical information:
<ul>
    <li><b>Protocol version:</b> 0.9.1</li>
    <li><b>Dedicated Broker:</b> RabbitMQ</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>After data point change - remember to reconnect the DataSource<br>Click on: Disable and Enable button</h4>
<h2>Usage:</h2>
<p>AMQP Data Source can be useful in a number of ways.<br>For example:
<ul>
    <li>Receiving data queued in the broker from IoT Devices</li>
    <li>It can receive logs messages from different devices which produce logs to specific topic</li>
    <li>To keep up-to-date with the news sending to the broker</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>Why v0.9.1?</h2>
<p>
    ScadaLTS has implemented AMQP protocol in version 0.9.1 because of a few reasons. Firstly official
    AMQP 1.0 OASIS protocol it is very different from the 0.9.1 version. AMQP 1.0 imposes fewer semantic
    requirements, so it is easier to add suppor for AMQP 1.0 existing brokers but the protocol is
    more complex than 0.9.1 and there are fewer client implementations.
</p>
<p>
    RabbitMQ support 0.9.1 version by sharing the package called com.rabbitmq.client which contains
    all necessary Java classes to communicate within devices by this protocol version. It has also
    great tutorials, guides and easy API to start programming. So based on the popularity of the
    community we have chosen this version.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Each AMQP Receiver Data Source require some parameters:
<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b> - Data Source unique display name</li>
    <li><b>Server IP Address</b> - IP address of the broker to which we want to connect</li>
    <li><b>Server Port</b> - Port on which the broker listen to (default = 5672)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>There are also some optional parameters:
<ul>
    <li><b>RabbitMQ username</b> - username required to login into the broker</li>
    <li><b>RabbitMQ user password</b> - username password required to authenticate the user</li>
    <li><b>Virtual Host</b> - Virtual host of the broker instance. In the single machine there could be more than one virtual machines. (default = "/")</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Extras</h2>
<p>
    From <a href="https://github.com/SCADA-LTS/Scada-LTS">official repository</a> there are some mini-applications
    which allow user to test the connectivity between ScadaLTS and other remote systems. There are two python 2.7 scripts
    (Producer - sendRabbitMQ.py and Consumer - recvRabbitMQ.py) which can be configured to produce data to your ScadaLTS
    Consumer can also receive data sent from Scada if it is bind to proper exchange with required routing key. To run this
    scripts there is required "pika" library which can be installed from the Internet. You can do it very simple just open your CommandLine
    and type 'pip install pika' and wait for the end.
</p>
<p>
    Script files are located in directory: <b>examples/dataSources/amqp</b>
</p>
<p>
    ScadaLTS can also send a messages to related queue. It is as simple as it was for other DataPoint. Just open "watch list" menu
    select wrench button, type a new message which you want to send, and press link [send]. You can check your message on the other device.
