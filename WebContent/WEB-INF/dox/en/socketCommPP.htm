<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
Each datapoint configured into the Socket Communication datasource corresponding to a value received from the service, running at the <b>Host</b> defined into the datasource and 
listening to socket connections at the configured <b>Port</b>.  
</p>
<p>
Every new point added to this datasource is identified by a <b>Name</b> and an internal identifier automatically generated, <b>Export ID</b>.
There are two communication possibilities depending on how the server service provides the data:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Command sending and response receiving</li>
<li>Periodically data receiving</li>
</ol>
<h3>Command sending and response receiving</h3>
<p>
If the server needs to be queried to provide a data value, the first thing to do is establish the <b>Number of commands</b> needed to get the desired response from the server. 
If only one command is needed to get the sought response from the server, a <b>First Command</b> is sent. If two or three commands are needed to get the sought response from the server, 
the response to the first command is compared to the <b>Expected response for first command</b>. If both match, a <b>Second command</b> is sent and the same process is done with the <b>Expected response for second command</b>,
if a <b>Third Command</b> is needed. If the server responses match the expected ones configured into the data point, a value from the final response (the sought one) is stored as as a binary, numeric, multistate or 
alphanumeric data (<b>Data Type</b>), based on the regular expression "mask" at <b>Value regex</b>.   
</p>
<h3>Periodically data receiving</h3>
<p>
If the server sends data periodically without receiving any command from the datasource, the <b>Number of commands</b> field from each datapoint should be kept with a <b>zero</b> value, indicating that the datasource
is configured to only receive data from the server service (No command is sent to the server).The final value to be stored as datapoint is selected based on a regular expression (<b>Value regex</b>).      
Depending on the <b>Data type</b>, the value obtained from the server is stored as a binary, numeric, multistate or alphanumeric data.
