  The <b>Data type</b> is the Mango representation of the value. Received data is automatically converted to the 
  required data type.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>Feed ID</b> and <b>Data stream ID</b> are used to uniquely identify a data stream. Requests for multiple 
  streams within a single feed are consolidated for efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  For the binary data type, the <b>Binary 0 value</b> can be defined. If the value found in the content matches it, the 
  point will be updated with 0. Otherwise, the point is updated with 1.
