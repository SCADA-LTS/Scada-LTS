<h1>Welcome to ScadaBR</h1>

<p>ScadaBR is the most advanced and functional open source M2M platform available, with capabilities only otherwise to be found&mdash;if at all&mdash;at a cost of thousands of dollars per instance. And of course, all this power is delivered entirely via an internet browser. No workstation software to install. No plugins.</p>

<p>Please enter your username and password to log in. If you do not have an account on this system or have forgotten your password, contact your ScadaBR M2M administrator for assistance.</p>

<p>If this instance of ScadaBR has just been installed, log in with username "admin" and password "admin". Note that for security reasons you should change the admin password immediately.</p>
