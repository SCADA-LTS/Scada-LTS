<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The HTTP sender publisher sends each point update (or change, as appropriate) to a given destination URL.
</p>

<h1>HTTP sender properties</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Method</b> selection determines which HTTP method type will be used to deliver the data. The data sent is 
  either case is identical; the difference is a matter of message structure. The <b>URL</b> defines the resource to 
  which to send the data. Valid schemes include "http" and "https". The server can be a domain name or an IP address. 
  Paths and query strings are also valid.
</p>
<p>
  A list of <b>Static headers</b> and <b>Static parameters</b> can also be added. These data are included with every 
  request sent to the URL. As such, this is an appropriate place to include authorization credentials or other 
  identifying artifacts. To add a static headers and parameter, enter its key and value, and click the 
  <img src="images/add.png"/> icon. To delete any existing static header or parameter, click the 
  <img src="images/bullet_delete.png"/> icon associated with the entry.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Date format</b> selection determines how the publisher will format timestamps associated with point values. The
  "basic" format is of the form "yyyyMMddHHmmss". "Time zone" is similar, but includes more information regarding the 
  locale of the timestamp. It is of the form "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'". "UTC" uses a numeric value that represents the
  number of milliseconds elapsed since midnight on Jan 1, 1970.  
</p>

<h1>HTTP response</h1>
<p>
  Any other response code than a "200 OK" is considered an error, and an alarm will be raised. In addition, any response 
  content included with an OK response is considered to be warning information. The <b>Raise result warning</b> setting 
  controls whether the existence of any response content causes an information alarm to be raised including the content 
  in the event message.
</p>

<h1>Configuration testing</h1>
<p>
  A test request can be sent&mdash;using the given configuration but including only static parameters&mdash;by clicking 
  the "Send static parameters" button. The result of the send attempt will be displayed below the buttons. To cancel a 
  test before it times out on its own, click the "Cancel" button.
</p>

<h1>Published points</h1>
<p>
  The <b>Points</b> section lists the points to be published. Point publishing can be enabled 
  (<img src="images/brick_go.png"/>) or disabled (<img src="images/brick_stop.png"/>). Disabling a point allows it to 
  not be used without having to explicitly delete it. The <b>Parameter name</b> is the key that will be used for the 
  point in the request parameters. The value will be the present value of the point. Select <b>Include timestamp</b> to 
  include a parameter in the request that contains the update time for the value. The key for the time will be "__time", 
  and the date will be encoded according to the date format value. (See the "Date/time formats" documentation for 
  more information.)
</p>
<p>
  To add a point to the point list, select it in the points list and click the <img src="images/icon_comp_add.png"/> 
  icon. To delete an existing point, click its associated <img src="images/bullet_delete.png"/> icon.
