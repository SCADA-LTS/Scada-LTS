<p>The attributes used to configure SQL data source points differ slightly depending upon whether the query is row-based or column-based. In both cases the <b>Data type</b> determines the data type of the ScadaBR data point. Values from the result set are automatically converted to this type. </p>

<p>For row-based queries, the <b>Row identifier</b> is matched against the first column of the result set to find the row or rows that contain values (the second column) for this point. Time overrides are taken from the third column if it exists.</p>

<p>For column-based queries, the <b>Column name</b> corresponds to the column name in the result set from which the point's value is extracted. The <b>Time override column</b> (optional) specifies the column to use as the point's time override. Note that multiple points can use the same time override if appropriate.</p>

<h1>Update statements</h1>
<p>An <b>Update statement</b> can optionally be defined for a point, which determines how the point's value can be set in the database. This is a standard SQL statement using "update" or "insert". If this statement is not defined the point will be considered non-settable.</p>
