<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  This data source is used to collect generic information from Pachube. Data is organized on Pachube in feeds, which 
  are collections of data streams. Since a data stream maps to a Mango point, the definition of a Pachube point is made
  by specifying both a feed and a stream id. This is a polling data source.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description. The <b>Update period</b> determines how often 
  the HTTP request to Pachube is made. Note that - depending on your account with Pachube - API request restrictions 
  may apply. See <a href="http://community.pachube.com/api#rate_limit">http://community.pachube.com/api#rate_limit</a>
  for details.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>API key</b> is needed to access private data. You can find it in the "my settings" area when you log in to 
  your Pachube account. The <b>Timeout</b> and <b>Retry</b> fields determine how long to wait for the web server to 
  return the data, and how many times to retry the connection in the event of failures. If all of the retries are 
  exhausted, a data source exception event is raised.
