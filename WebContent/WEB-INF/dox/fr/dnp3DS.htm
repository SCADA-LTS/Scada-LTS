<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>Every datasource requires one <b>Name</b>, that may contain any
description.</p>
<p>The <b>Source Address</b> is the master address, or, the
datasource's to be registered address and the <b>Slave Address</b> is
the remote device address to which you wish to communicate.</p>
<p>The <b>RBE Poll Period</b> corresponds to the time interval upon
which the system makes requisitions of classes 1, 2 an 3 (events) to the
slave device. The <b>Static Poll Period</b> corresponds to the time
interval upon which the system makes requisitions of class 0 to the
device and is <b>relative to the RBE polling period</b>, so, if RBE
period = 2s and Static Poll Period = 30,<b> the datasource will
require class 0 data every 60 seconds to the device.</b></p>
