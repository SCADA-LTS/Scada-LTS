<p>Anonymous access</p>
<p>To support anonymous views, a special user "anonymous-user" has been created in which, as for an ordinary user, we can define specific permissions, including the views that we want to make available to an anonymous user. </p>
<p>To be able to change the value on the settable point, you should:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Select "set" permission to the datapoint or permission to the datasource in which the datapoint is located;</li>
    <li>Select "set" permission to the view;</li>
    <li>Select "set" permission for an anonymous user on view;</li>
</ol>
<p>If the "read" permission is set on any level, it will be possible to read the value of a given point from the view at most.</p>
<p>If we want to be able to set anonymous access on the view, an admin should be set for this special user.</p>
