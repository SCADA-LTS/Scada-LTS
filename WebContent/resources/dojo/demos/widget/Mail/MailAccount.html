This is a simple application mockup showing some of the dojo widgets:
<ul>
  <li>split pane</li>
  <li>floating pane</li>
  <li>layout pane</li>
  <li>tree</li>
  <li>button</li>
  <li>TabContainer</li>
  <li>editor</li>
</ul>
Click on the messages in the Inbox, or try to edit the options or create a new message.
There's no server running, so the app is just a facade and it doesn't really do anything.
