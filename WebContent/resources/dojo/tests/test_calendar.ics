DESCRIPTION:
 Okay, so you were a star in high school ? maybe 
 never cracked a book! But being successful 
 in high school does not automatically mean you 
 will be successful in college. Not only do 
 you need the brains to succeed, you need the 
 ?know how?. This seminar is designed to help 
 you develop the ?know how? without sacrificing 
 everything else in your life. Topics covered 
 include note-taking and study skills, effective 
 reading techniques, how to be a good listener, 
 working with professors, and more! Don't 
 be satisfied with just getting by - learn 
 how you to excel in your academics. \n\n

SUMMARY:"How to Be a Successful HOKIE"
DESCRIPTION:
 Okay, so you were a star in high school ? maybe 
 never cracked a book! But being successful 
 in high school does not automatically mean you 
 will be successful in college. Not only do 
 you need the brains to succeed, you need the 
 ?know how?. This seminar is designed to help 
 you develop the ?know how? without sacrificing 
 everything else in your life. Topics covered 
 include note-taking and study skills, effective 
 reading techniques, how to be a good listener, 
 working with professors, and more! Don't 
 be satisfied with just getting by - learn 
 how you to excel in your academics. \n\n
