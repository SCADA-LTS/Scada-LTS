/**
 * This class is useful when an exclusive, long-running task gets called more often than is practical. For example, a
 * large object needs to be persisted, but it changes fairly often. This class will execute the submitted runnable
 * if there is currently nothing running. If another task is already running, the new task will wait. If there is
 * already a task waiting, the new task will replace the waiting task. So, tasks that are started are always allowed to
 * complete, but tasks that are no necessary to run are discarded.
