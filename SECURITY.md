# Security Policy

## To report a security issue

1. Use the contact address scadalts-support (at) softq.pl
2. Provide description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue etc.

- If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

- Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
